## What is Slurm

**Slurm** (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management) is a *workload manager*
/ *job scheduler* for HPC clusters. Instead of everyone SSHing onto machines and
fighting over CPUs and GPUs, you describe the resources your job needs and Slurm
queues it, finds a node that fits, runs it, and cleans up afterwards. This keeps
the cluster fairly shared and fully utilised.

Key concepts:

- **Login node** — where you land when you SSH in. Use it to edit files and
  submit jobs. **Do not run heavy work here.**
- **Compute nodes** — the machines that actually run your jobs.
- **`slurmctld`** — the controller daemon that schedules everything.
- **Partition** — a named queue of nodes (e.g. `cpu`, `gpu`, `short`). You pick
  one per job.
- **Job vs. step** — a *job* is one submission (`sbatch`/`srun`); a job can run
  multiple *steps* (each `srun` inside it).
- **Resource request** — CPUs, memory, time, and GPUs you ask for. Slurm grants
  exactly that, so request what you actually use.

### The job lifecycle

```
submit  →  PENDING (in queue)  →  RUNNING  →  COMPLETED / FAILED
```

You don't have to stay connected for batch jobs — submit and log off, the job
keeps running. `squeue` shows where your job currently sits in this cycle.

---

## Basic Commands

| Command     | What it does                                              |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sinfo`     | Show partitions and node states                          |
| `squeue`    | Show queued/running jobs (`squeue --me` for just yours)  |
| `sbatch`    | Submit a batch job script                                |
| `srun`      | Run a command/step (interactively or inside a job)       |
| `salloc`    | Grab an interactive allocation (a shell on a node)       |
| `scancel`   | Cancel a job (`scancel <jobid>`)                         |
| `sacct`     | Accounting/history for finished jobs                     |
| `scontrol`  | Inspect/modify jobs, nodes, partitions                   |

## Cluster Information

```bash
# Partitions, availability, time limits, node counts
sinfo

# One line per node, long format (state, CPUs, memory)
sinfo -N -l

# Everything about one node, including Gres (GPUs)
scontrol show node <nodename>

# Partition limits (max time, default mem, allowed accounts)
scontrol show partition <partition>
```

Reading `sinfo`: the `STATE` column tells you what's usable — `idle` (free),
`mix` (partly used), `alloc` (full), `down`/`drain` (unavailable).

## Tutorial Code Snippets

### First Connection to the Slurm Cluster

> **Before you start:** you can SSH into the login node with a valid key
> and university account — but that alone doesn't let you run jobs. If
> `srun`/`sbatch` fail (e.g. with an association/account error) even though
> `ssh slurm` works fine, you don't have a local Slurm account yet — **contact
> the server admin** to get one set up.

> **Note:** you *can* log in with just your username and password
> (`ssh <your-uni-username>@sl-li.informatik.uni-rostock.de`), no key required
> — but this is **not recommended**: passwords are weaker (phishable,
> guessable, reusable across sites) and get prompted for on every connection.
> Set up an SSH key as below and use that instead.

1. **Create an SSH key** (skip if you already have one):

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<your-uni-username>@uni-rostock"
   ```

2. **Add it to your agent** so you don't retype the passphrase:

   ```bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   ```

3. **Copy the public key to the server:**

   ```bash
   ssh-copy-id <your-uni-username>@sl-li.informatik.uni-rostock.de
   ```

4. **Add a host block** to `~/.ssh/config` so you can just type `ssh slurm`.
   `ForwardAgent yes` lets the login node reuse your local key (e.g. to clone
   from GitHub) without copying the private key onto the cluster.

   ```sshconfig
   Host slurm
       HostName sl-li.informatik.uni-rostock.de
       User <your-uni-username>
       ForwardAgent yes
       # ProxyJump <gateway>   # uncomment only if you must hop through a gateway
   ```

5. **Connect:**

   ```bash
   ssh slurm
   ```

#### Windows (PowerShell, no Git Bash/WSL)

Steps 1–5 above work as-is in **Git Bash** or **WSL**. If you'd rather use
Windows' built-in OpenSSH client directly from **PowerShell**, here's the
equivalent:

1. **Create an SSH key:**

   ```powershell
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<your-uni-username>@uni-rostock"
   ```

   Accept the default path (`C:\Users\<you>\.ssh\id_ed25519`).

2. **Start the ssh-agent service and add your key** (run PowerShell **as
   Administrator** once, just for the `Set-Service` line):

   ```powershell
   Set-Service ssh-agent -StartupType Automatic
   Start-Service ssh-agent
   ssh-add $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_ed25519
   ```

3. **Copy the public key to the server.** Windows has no `ssh-copy-id`, so
   append it by hand over SSH:

   ```powershell
   Get-Content $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_ed25519.pub | ssh <your-uni-username>@sl-li.informatik.uni-rostock.de "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
   ```

4. **Add the same host block** to `C:\Users\<you>\.ssh\config` (create the
   file if it doesn't exist yet) — the content is identical to step 4 above.

5. **Connect:** `ssh slurm` works the same from PowerShell once the config
   file is in place.

> If `ssh-add` can't find the agent, double check the `ssh-agent` service is
> running (`Get-Service ssh-agent`) — it needs to be `Running`, not just
> `Stopped`.

### Project setup (uv + clone)

Now that you're on the login node, set up the project. We use
[**uv**](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage the Python environment — it reads
`pyproject.toml`/`uv.lock` and builds an identical `.venv` for everyone. Run this
**on the login node** (it has internet; compute nodes may not).

1. **Install uv** (skip if `uv --version` already works):

   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   # then restart your shell, or:  source $HOME/.local/bin/env
   ```

2. **Clone the repo and build the env.** Agent forwarding (the `ForwardAgent yes`
   from your SSH config) lets the clone authenticate to GitHub with your laptop's
   key — nothing private is copied onto the cluster:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:<you>/slurmtutorial.git
   cd slurmtutorial
   uv sync                 # creates .venv from pyproject.toml + uv.lock
   ```

   `uv sync` pulls the pinned **CUDA 12.4** build of torch plus numpy and
   jupyterlab (see [GPU environment](#gpu-environment-cuda-build-of-torch)). The
   example scripts `source .venv/bin/activate` themselves, so once `.venv` exists
   they just work.

### Overview over the cluster

Once you're on the login node, get the lay of the land:

```bash
sinfo                 # which partitions and nodes exist, and their state
squeue --me           # your jobs
squeue                # everyone's jobs (how busy is it?)
sinfo -N -l           # detailed per-node view (CPUs, memory, state)
```

Example `sinfo` output:

```
PARTITION    AVAIL  TIMELIMIT  NODES  STATE NODELIST
compute-node    up 1-00:00:00      4   idle node[001-004]
gpu-node-mig    up 1-00:00:00      1   idle node201
login-node      up 1-00:00:00      1   idle sl-li
gpu-node        up 1-00:00:00      2   idle node[101-102]
gpu-node-bw     up 1-00:00:00      2   idle node[121-122]
```

The `TIMELIMIT` column (`1-00:00:00` = 1 day) is the **max** wall-clock a job may
request on that partition — ask for more and it's rejected.

Our partitions: **`compute-node`** (CPU jobs), **`gpu-node-mig`** (small GPU
slices via MIG — great for tutorials/dev), and **`gpu-node`** 
(full GPUs for heavier work). Examples below use `compute-node` and
`gpu-node-mig`.

### The hardware

![Cluster overview](figures/ClusterOverview.svg)

- **GPU nodes** (`gpu-node`) — each node has **4× NVIDIA H200** GPUs. Use these
  for full-GPU training and heavier work.
- **GPU nodes** (`gpu-node-bw`) — each node has **NVIDIA B6000 RTX** GPUs.
- **MIG node** (`gpu-node-mig`, `node201`) — **2× H200** sliced with MIG
  (Multi-Instance GPU) into smaller, independent GPUs:
  - one H200 → **4 slices of ~33 GB** each,
  - one H200 → **7 slices of ~16 GB** each.

  MIG slices are ideal for tutorials, development, and inference where a whole
  H200 would be overkill — you get a guaranteed slice without waiting for a full
  GPU.
- **Compute nodes** (`compute-node`) — CPU-only, for preprocessing and non-GPU
  jobs.

![GPU node: 4× H200](figures/GPUNode.svg)

![MIG node: 2× H200 sliced into 4×33 GB and 7×16 GB](figures/GPUNodeMig.svg)

Requesting MIG slices on `gpu-node-mig`:

- **Any** slice — just `--gres=gpu:1`; Slurm hands you whichever is free.
- A **specific size** — name the MIG type: `--gres=gpu:1g.33gb:1` (≈33 GB, 4
  available) or `--gres=gpu:1g.16gb:1` (≈16 GB, 7 available). The type strings
  come from the node's GRES config:

  ```bash
  scontrol show node node201 | grep -i Gres
  # Gres=gpu:1g.33gb:4,gpu:1g.16gb:7
  ```

Ready-made scripts: [`examples/gpu_mig_33gb.sbatch`](examples/gpu_mig_33gb.sbatch)
and [`examples/gpu_mig_16gb.sbatch`](examples/gpu_mig_16gb.sbatch).

### srun vs. sbatch vs. salloc

All three ask Slurm for resources — they differ in **how you interact with the
allocation**:

- **`sbatch`** — submit a *script*; it runs **unattended** when resources free up.
  You get your prompt back immediately and can log off; output goes to the log
  file. The workhorse for real jobs.
- **`salloc`** — get an **interactive allocation**: it drops you into a shell that
  *holds* the resources, so you run commands by hand. `exit` releases it.
- **`srun`** — launches a task (a *job step*) **onto** an allocation. What
  allocation depends on where you run it:

| Where you run `srun`            | What happens                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| inside an `sbatch` script       | a job *step* on the nodes the batch job already holds              |
| inside an `salloc` shell        | a step on the interactive allocation you're holding               |
| standalone from the login node  | makes its **own** allocation, runs, blocks, then releases it      |

**`salloc` vs. standalone `srun`** (the confusing pair): `srun --pty bash`
creates an allocation **and runs one thing in it** (the shell) — when that exits,
the allocation is gone. `salloc` creates an allocation you **keep**, then you fire
multiple (or multi-node) `srun` steps against it.

> **Rule of thumb:** `sbatch` for unattended jobs · `salloc` for a multi-step
> interactive session · `srun` to place work onto an allocation (or a quick
> one-off).

### SRUN — run something now

`srun` runs a command on a compute node and blocks until it finishes. Great for
quick tests and interactive work.

```bash
# Run our Monte-Carlo pi estimate on a compute node, 1 CPU:
srun --partition=compute-node --cpus-per-task=1 --time=00:05:00 \
     python examples/pi_estimate.py 5000000

# Get an interactive shell on a compute node (great for debugging):
srun --partition=compute-node --pty bash
```

Source: [`examples/pi_estimate.py`](examples/pi_estimate.py).

### SBATCH — submit a batch job

For real work you write a *batch script*: a normal shell script whose `#SBATCH`
lines describe the resource request. You submit it and Slurm runs it whenever a
slot is free — no need to stay connected.

Every batch script should specify at least: **partition**, **time limit**,
**memory**, **CPUs**, and (if you need a GPU) **GRES**.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=pi-demo
#SBATCH --partition=compute-node # which queue (see `sinfo`)
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1        # CPUs for your program
#SBATCH --mem=512M               # RAM per node
#SBATCH --time=00:05:00          # hard wall-clock limit (HH:MM:SS)
#SBATCH --output=logs/%x-%j.out  # %x=job name, %j=job id

echo "Running on host: $(hostname)"
srun python examples/pi_estimate.py 5000000
```

Submit and watch it:

```bash
mkdir -p logs                 # the --output path must exist
sbatch examples/srun_demo.sbatch
squeue --me                   # watch it queue and run
cat logs/pi-demo-*.out        # read the output when done
```

**GPU jobs** add a `--gres` line to request a GPU:

```bash
#SBATCH --partition=gpu-node-mig
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:1          # 1 GPU (a MIG slice on this partition)
```

Full files: [`examples/srun_demo.sbatch`](examples/srun_demo.sbatch) (CPU) and
[`examples/gpu.sbatch`](examples/gpu.sbatch) +
[`examples/gpu_check.py`](examples/gpu_check.py) (GPU).

#### GPU environment (CUDA build of torch)

A GPU allocation is only half the story — **the `torch` in your env must be a CUDA
build.** This project pins the **CUDA 12.4** build of torch in `uv.lock` (pulled
from the PyTorch cu124 index, see [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml)), so a plain
sync sets everything up. Build the env **once on the cluster login node** (it has
internet; compute nodes may not):

```bash
ssh slurm && cd <repo>
uv sync                        # creates .venv with torch 2.6.0+cu124, numpy, jupyterlab
```

The GPU example scripts `source .venv/bin/activate` themselves, so once `.venv`
exists they just work. We activate the prebuilt venv rather than `uv run` inside
the job, because compute nodes are often offline and `uv run` would try to
re-resolve over the network. Verify with `sbatch examples/gpu.sbatch`; the log
should print `torch 2.6.0+cu124  (built for CUDA: 12.4)` and a device name.

### Logs & output (important!)

A batch job runs detached — you're not watching the terminal — so **its log file
is your only window into what happened.** Always set `--output`, and check it.

- `#SBATCH --output=logs/%x-%j.out` captures **stdout**. The `%x` (job name) and
  `%j` (job id) placeholders keep files unique so jobs don't overwrite each other.
  Without `--output`, Slurm dumps everything into `slurm-<jobid>.out` in your
  current directory — easy to lose track of.
- `#SBATCH --error=logs/%x-%j.err` sends **stderr** to a separate file. Handy for
  spotting failures fast; omit it and stderr is merged into the `.out`.
- The `logs/` directory **must exist first** — `mkdir -p logs` before submitting.
- **Watch a running job live:**

  ```bash
  tail -f logs/pi-demo-12345.out
  ```

- In Python, `print(..., flush=True)` (or `python -u`) so progress shows up in the
  log immediately instead of being buffered until the job ends — see
  [`examples/checkpoint.py`](examples/checkpoint.py).

When a job fails, the log is the **first** place to look (`sacct -j <jobid>` tells
you the exit state; the log tells you *why*).

---

## Development Workflow (git-based)

Don't edit code directly on the cluster. Develop and test on your laptop, push to
git, and pull on the cluster — the cluster just *runs* what's in git. This keeps
your laptop and the cluster in sync and your history clean.

```
laptop:  edit + test  →  git commit  →  git push
                                            │
cluster:                          git pull  →  sbatch  →  read logs
```

**One-time setup on the cluster** (uses agent forwarding from your SSH config, so
your laptop's key authenticates to GitHub — nothing private is copied over):

```bash
ssh slurm
git clone git@github.com:<you>/<repo>.git
cd <repo>
uv sync                      # reproduce the Python env from pyproject.toml
```

**Each iteration:**

```bash
# 1. On your laptop: make changes, test quickly, then publish
git add -A && git commit -m "tweak training step"
git push

# 2. On the cluster: pull and submit
ssh slurm
cd <repo>
git pull
sbatch examples/srun_demo.sbatch
squeue --me                  # watch it
cat logs/*.out               # inspect results, then repeat
```

> **Tip:** keep `logs/` and any large outputs out of git (add them to
> `.gitignore`) — commit code, not run artifacts.

---

## Advanced

### Job Dependencies (build a pipeline)

You often want job B to run only after job A succeeds — e.g. preprocess, then
train. Capture A's job id with `--parsable` and pass it to B's `--dependency`:

```bash
mkdir -p logs
# Submit step A and grab its job id
jid=$(sbatch --parsable examples/step_a.sbatch)
echo "step A is job $jid"

# Submit step B; it waits until A finishes successfully (afterok)
sbatch --dependency=afterok:$jid examples/step_b.sbatch

squeue --me   # step B shows state (Dependency) until A is done
```

> Step A deliberately lingers ~90s (a `sleep` after the work) so you have time to
> run `squeue --me` and watch step B sit in `(Dependency)` until A finishes — drop
> that `sleep` for real pipelines.

Common dependency types: `afterok` (A succeeded), `afterany` (A finished, any
result), `afternotok` (A failed). Files:
[`examples/step_a.sbatch`](examples/step_a.sbatch),
[`examples/step_b.sbatch`](examples/step_b.sbatch),
[`examples/primes.py`](examples/primes.py).

### Job Arrays (run many similar jobs)

When you need to run the *same* job many times with only a small difference each
time — a parameter sweep, repeated runs with different seeds, or processing a list
of input shards — don't submit N scripts by hand. A **job array** does it with one
`sbatch`: Slurm fans the submission out into independent *tasks* that differ only
by an index, `$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID`.

```bash
#SBATCH --array=0-4                 # 5 tasks: task ids 0,1,2,3,4
#SBATCH --output=logs/%x-%A_%a.out  # %A = array job id, %a = task id
```

Inside the script, read `$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID` to pick this task's work:

```bash
samples=$(( (SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID + 1) * 1000000 ))
srun python examples/pi_estimate.py "$samples"
```

Submit and watch the tasks:

```bash
mkdir -p logs
sbatch examples/array_job.sbatch
squeue --me     # tasks appear as <jobid>_0, <jobid>_1, ... scheduled independently
```

The `--array` spec is flexible: ranges (`0-9`), lists (`1,3,5`), and steps
(`0-9:2`). Add `%N` to **throttle** how many run at once — `--array=0-19%4` keeps
at most 4 tasks running simultaneously, which keeps you a good cluster citizen on a
shared queue.

> Use `%A` (array job id) and `%a` (task id) in `--output` so every task writes its
> own log instead of clobbering one file. `scancel <jobid>` cancels the whole
> array; `scancel <jobid>_<taskid>` cancels a single task.

Files: [`examples/array_job.sbatch`](examples/array_job.sbatch),
[`examples/pi_estimate.py`](examples/pi_estimate.py).

### Send Mail

Let Slurm email you when a job changes state:

```bash
#SBATCH --mail-type=BEGIN,END,FAIL              # or ALL
#SBATCH --mail-user=<your-email>
```

Quick demo — fire a one-line job and watch the BEGIN/END mails land:

```bash
sbatch --mail-type=ALL --mail-user=<your-email> \
       --partition=compute-node --time=00:01:00 --wrap="echo hello from \$(hostname); sleep 10"
```

### Run Jupyter Lab on a compute node

The idea: Jupyter runs on a **compute node**, and you reach it from your laptop's
browser through an SSH tunnel. We use a **reverse tunnel** — the compute node
pushes its port *back* to the login node, then your laptop forwards from the login
node. This works even when the login node can't reach the compute node directly (a
firewall between login and compute nodes is common, and a plain `-L
8888:<node>:8888` tunnel then fails). Step by step:

1. **SSH into the cluster:**

   ```bash
   ssh slurm
   ```

2. **Activate an env with Jupyter** (the same `.venv` from the
   [GPU environment](#gpu-environment-cuda-build-of-torch) setup, which has both
   `jupyterlab` and a CUDA torch):

   ```bash
   cd slurmtutorial
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter on a compute node and push its port to the login node.** This
   grabs a GPU slice, opens a reverse tunnel back to the login node (`sl-li`), and
   starts the server bound to localhost (only the tunnels can reach it):

   ```bash
   srun --partition=gpu-node-mig --gres=gpu:1 --time=04:00:00 --pty bash -c '
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ssh -fN -R 8888:localhost:8888 sl-li          # push port back to login node
     jupyter lab --no-browser --ip=127.0.0.1 --port=8888
   '
   ```

   No GPU needed? Use `--partition=compute-node` and drop `--gres=gpu:1`.
   (We activate the prebuilt `.venv` inside the `srun` rather than `uv run`, since
   the compute node may not have internet to re-resolve the env.)

4. **Copy the token URL** it prints, like
   `http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=abc123...`. With the reverse tunnel you no
   longer need the node name — the port is already on the login node.

5. **Open the tunnel from your laptop** (new terminal, *not* on the cluster). This
   forwards your local port 8888 to the login node, which already has the port from
   the reverse tunnel:

   ```bash
   ssh -N -L 8888:localhost:8888 slurm
   ```

   Leave this running.

6. **Open Jupyter** in your browser: paste the token URL from step 4, but use the
   local address — `http://localhost:8888/lab?token=abc123...`.

7. **When you're done:** `Ctrl-C` the `srun` session on the cluster (this ends the
   job, frees the GPU, and tears down the reverse tunnel), then `Ctrl-C` the tunnel
   on your laptop.

> **Tip:** the reverse-tunnel port (`8888` here) lives on the **shared login
> node**, so if someone else is already using it your `ssh -R` will silently fail
> to bind. Pick a unique port (e.g. `8900` + your favourite number) and use it
> consistently in the `-R`, the `--port`, and your laptop's `-L`.

### Requeue after time limit (with checkpointing)

For jobs longer than the partition's time limit, checkpoint progress and have
Slurm requeue the job to resume. The script asks Slurm to send `SIGUSR1` shortly
before the limit (`--signal=B:USR1@30`), traps it, saves state, and requeues:

```bash
mkdir -p logs
sbatch examples/requeue.sbatch
```

The Python side traps the signal, writes a checkpoint, and exits cleanly so the
requeued run can pick up where it stopped. Files:
[`examples/requeue.sbatch`](examples/requeue.sbatch),
[`examples/checkpoint.py`](examples/checkpoint.py).

## Being a Good Cluster Citizen

The cluster is shared — a few habits keep it pleasant for everyone:

- **Never run heavy work on the login node.** Use `srun`/`sbatch` to push it to a
  compute node.
- **Request realistic time and memory.** Over-asking leaves resources idle and
  makes you wait longer in the queue.
- **Clean up.** `scancel` jobs you no longer need.
- **Pick the right partition** — `compute-node` for CPU work, `gpu-node-mig` for
  small/dev GPU jobs, `gpu-node` / `gpu-node-bw` for heavier GPU runs.
